# Cheatsheet collection

Whenever I find some useful commands and some time, I will add them to my cheatsheet collection.

I use [navi](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi/tree/master) for finding and using my cheatsheets, it works great!

## Current collections

- ssh.cheat: ssh related stuff like creating a connection, creating a key, where to store public keys on a server, how to secure ssh
